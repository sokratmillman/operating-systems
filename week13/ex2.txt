Recovery: disadvantage is in killing the whole process which causes problem, but still applicable approach in some cases



Prevention: disadvantage is in time consumption. Since it checks the possibility of deadlock with every request and tries to fix it, it consumes a lot of time resource and rejects parallelism
however, applicable if the system is not real-time or time is not that matters

Avoidance: advantage is that we can say beforehand which process is safe and which is not with Banker's algorithm -> it seems to be more useful approach in average
